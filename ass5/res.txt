a) V0neg
* The vfield slows down after center region,
	acts a bit crazy around the borders of the center region,
	B0 sweep:
	o magnitude slows down more relative to B0 size (!prop)
	U0 sweep:
	o Relative impact of center-region decrease with U0 size
	  same decrease but lower relative impact on velocity?
* Pressure increases until centerregion wher it is ~0.
	Pressure starts at negative, decreases slightly until CR,
	increases agressively inside CR, decreases slightly after CR
	B0 sweep:
	o Vastly increased magnitude with B0 (!prop)
	U0 sweep:
	o Slight decreases outside CR gets slightly more aggressive with higher U0,
	o U0 = .9 starts to show signs of instability, likely due to it entering the
		transition region to turbulence
	o Different speeds has very low impact on the pressure.

b) V0pos


FIX:
*y Edit V0pos_B-001,01,017_allfields.png to range: -.4,.4
*x Edit V0pos_U-001,3,6,9_allfields.png  to range: -.4,.4
*y Edit V0pos_U-006_allfields.png Zoom to fit [-1,1],[-.05,.05]
* Get V0X_U,B-002.eps
* Get V0X_v_B-first,last.eps
* Get Velocity field streamline
* Get V0neg_p_U001369
