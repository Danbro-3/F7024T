a) V0neg
* The vfield slows down after center region,
	acts a bit crazy around the borders of the center region,
	B0 sweep:
	o magnitude slows down more relative to B0 size (!prop)
	U0 sweep:
	o Relative impact of center-region decrease with U0 size
	  same decrease but lower relative impact on velocity?
* Pressure increases until centerregion wher it is ~0.
	Pressure starts at negative, decreases slightly until CR,
	increases agressively inside CR, decreases slightly after CR
	B0 sweep:
	o Vastly increased magnitude with B0 (!prop)
	U0 sweep:
	o Slight decreases outside CR gets slightly more aggressive with higher U0,
	o U0 = .9 starts to show signs of instability, likely due to it entering the
		transition region to turbulence
	o Different speeds has very low impact on the pressure.

b) V0pos
